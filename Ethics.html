    <h1>Ethics</h1>
    

    <br><br>
   
        <p>To dive into the topic of ethics used in Information technology we first must define what is ethics? According to a website from Mccann, school of business and technology, "Ethics are defined as moral principles that govern a personâ€™s behavior or conduct of a certain activity" (mccann, 2023). In the modern age we use technology everywhere, the main reason is because it makes everything easier for us, not harder and especailly doesn't cause us harm or else we wouldn't use it.</p>
        <br> 

        <p> Like most things not everything is perfect, same goes for technology, there are instances were technology is not used in the right way and can be used unethically. Take for example privacy, privacy is a big concern for most if not all people as no one likes their private information available for everyone to see. Privacy has been for a long time and still is a big dilema when using technology. As quoted from a reseach paper focusing on privacy and information technology by standford encyclopedia of philosophy archive, "Recent advances in information technology threaten privacy and have reduced the amount of control over personal data and open up the possibility of a range of negative consequences as a result of access to personal data (Van den Hoven, 2019). It is clear that in a world of technology where information is transfered from place to place containg personal information or not, privacy should be kept private and only accesible to those its meant for. Privacy is just one example of many ethical issues that arises in technology. To continue our disuccion on ethics, I will address how can we improve the ethical problems we face in information technlogy.</p>
        <br>

        <p> The most important solution to balance ethical values and developing new technologies is to find and create a set of guidelines or rules that are established to form a grouded idea on what is considered ethcial or not in terms of technology and its use in society. An emerging research topic that grasps this idea is robot ethics. According to the Association for Advacning automation, an assocaiton who focuses on the automation of everything technology, "Robot ethics combines insights from experts in robotics, AI, computer science, and engineering with insights from experts in philosophy, law, psychology and sociology, in an attempt to ensure that automation designs and deployments do not create ethical hazards for individuals and society" (A3, 2022). As stated above combining the insights from many ethical perspectives allows us to have a clear guideline in the design and implementation of technology in society to ensure that it is safe for society. I belive this could be a solution to combat the ongoing ethical problems seen in information technology.</p>
